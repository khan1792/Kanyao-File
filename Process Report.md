## Steps
1. Fork the repository.
2. Download [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) as the management software. (All the following steps are completed in SourceTree)
3. Clone (File -> Clone/New) the remote repository(in github) and pull its content into my laptop.
4. Open README.md in local repository and change it via RStudio.
5. Save the changes in RStudio and stage README.md.
6. Click "Commit" on the **top left corner**, input some words in the input box at the bottom and click another "Commit" on the **bottom right corner**.
7. Click "Push"


## The Challenge

While it is easy to manage github via SourceTree, there is still a challenge when I change the README.md via RStudio. It is difficult to change the size of images and embed it into README.md.
My solutions are:
- Change the size of my picture in Photoshop before embedding.
- Create a new repository in my github for storing files, add the picture there and write a link to the picture in README.md.


## A Helpful Resource

There is a Chinese website that contains a brief markdown guide of how to set "header", "emphasis", "List", "link", "images", "super-/subscript", etc.
